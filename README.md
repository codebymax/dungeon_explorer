# dungeon_explorer
This project was a semester long project for the class Computer Science 327.

This project started off as a C project but then transitioned to C++ as the class went on.

When running the program there are a couple flags that can be used. First, --load loads the most recent dungeon that has been saved. --save will generate a new dungeon and save it. --nummon followed by an integer denotes how many monsters will be placed in the dungeon. The default value is 10.

When the program is run, a 21 x 80 dungeon is generated in the terminal window. 
The rooms are denoted with "." and the corridors with "#". The PC is an "@" symbol and monsters are denoted with letters and numbers around the dungeon.
